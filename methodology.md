## Methodology

This project followed a systematic approach to capture and analyze network traffic using Wireshark.

### 1. Traffic Capture
Wireshark was used to capture live network packets by selecting the active network interface.

### 2. Traffic Generation
Different types of traffic such as ICMP, HTTP, DNS, and TCP port scanning traffic were generated.

### 3. Filtering
Wireshark display filters were applied to isolate specific protocols and packet types.

### 4. Analysis
Captured packets were analyzed to understand protocol behavior and detect suspicious activities.

### 5. Documentation
Observations and findings were documented with screenshots and explanations.
